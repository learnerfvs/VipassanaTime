**Vipassana Time** is a meditation timer and practice tracker designed specifically for Vipassana meditators who have completed at least one 10-day Vipassana meditation retreat under S.N. Goenka tradition. Built by a fellow Vipassana practitioner.

## 🧘 Timer for Your Sittings

Set up your meditation sittings with the authentic sounds of S.N. Goenka's instructions. Choose from the traditional Goenkaji English Start and End sounds, or use simple bells. You can also upload your own custom sounds if you prefer a different audio.

**Flexible Duration:** Set your sitting time from 10 minutes to 2hours, with the default 1-hour option for full sittings. The timer displays time in HH:MM:SS format and shows your progress visually as the meditation fills from bottom to top.

## 📊 Track Your Practice

Maintain a complete record of your meditation journey with the app's comprehensive tracking system. Every sitting of 5 minutes or more is automatically logged with the date, time of day, and duration.

**Morning & Evening Sittings:** Your sittings are categorized by time of day - Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night, Early Morning, or Midnight - helping you see your practice patterns at a glance.

**Streak Tracking:** See how many consecutive days you've maintained your meditation practice. The streak motivates you to keep your daily commitment.

**Calendar View:** Browse your meditation history with an intuitive calendar. Days with sittings are highlighted, and you can click any date to see all your sittings for that day.

**Complete Log Management:**

- Add individual sittings with custom time and duration
- Edit existing sittings to correct any mistakes
- Delete sittings you no longer want to track
- Add multiple past sittings at once using the bulk add feature
- Delete multiple sittings in a date range with bulk delete

## ⚠️ Important Note

This app is a tool to support your meditation practice. It is not a substitute for the guidance of a qualified teacher or to replace attending Vipassana meditation retreats. The timer and tracking features are here to help you maintain your daily practice, but true understanding of Dhamma comes from your experience on the cushion and guidance from your teacher.

**Disclaimer:** This app and its developer are in no way affiliated with, endorsed by, or represent the official Vipassana Meditation organization or S.N. Goenka tradition. This is an independent meditation timer and practice tracking application created by a fellow Vipassana practitioner to support the Dhamma community.
