## Introduction

Vipassana Time is a meditation timer and practice tracking application designed to help Vipassana meditators maintain their daily Dhamma practice.

## Information We Collect

### 1. Local Meditation Records

When you use the meditation timer and complete a sitting of 5 minutes or more, the app stores the following information locally on your device:

- **Date of Meditation:** The date when you completed your sitting (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Time of Day:** The time when you started your meditation (format: HH:MM)
- **Duration:** The length of your meditation session in minutes
- **Timestamp:** A unique identifier for each session

This data is stored in your device's local storage and is used exclusively for:
- Displaying your meditation history in the Records tab
- Tracking your meditation streak (consecutive days of practice)
- Calculating statistics about your practice patterns

**This information is never transmitted to our servers.** All meditation records remain on your device under your control.

### 2. Anonymous Session Tracking (Optional)

When you start a meditation session, the app may anonymously record session usage statistics for the purpose of displaying global meditation statistics on the Home tab. This includes:

- **Anonymous User ID:** A randomly generated unique identifier assigned when you first use the app
- **Session Start Time:** When you began your meditation
- **Session End Time:** When you completed your meditation
- **Session Duration:** How long you meditated
- **Sound Selection:** Which start and end sounds you used

**Important:** This data is collected anonymously. We do not collect:
- Your name
- Your email address
- Your phone number
- Any other personally identifying information

The anonymous session data is stored securely on Supabase servers and is used solely to:
- Calculate how many people have meditated today
- Calculate how many people have meditated in the last hour
- Display these aggregated statistics to all users of the app

### 3. Custom Sounds

If you choose to upload custom meditation sounds, the app stores these audio files on your device in local storage. These files are never uploaded to our servers or shared with anyone.
